# FNA-NET
[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/FNA.NET)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FNA.NET/)

FNA-NET is a pure .NET 6+ fork of FNA. Its goal is to develop games with FNA/XNA on the morden .NET 6.0+ platform.

## Supported Platforms

Since it's ported with pure .NET 6.0 from FNA, it should only support platforms which .NET 6 supports. So console platforms(except Xbox one) should be not supported until .NET 6 does. Android is not supported like FNA for now, but there should be workarounds with Xamarin.Android.
